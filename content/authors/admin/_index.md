I am a data scientist and software engineer with expertise in machine learning, quantitative modeling and finance. My strong quantitative and analytical skills are rooted in a background in Electrical and Information Engineering, complemented by an MSc in Financial Engineering. I specialise in developing and deploying statistical and ML models and engineering data pipelines and inference systems. With a deep understanding of mathematical modeling, statistical inference, and AI-driven decision-making, I apply data-driven methodologies to solve complex problems.
