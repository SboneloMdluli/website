Key Concepts:

1. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A measure of the maximum potential loss over a period with a given confidence level. However, VaR has limitations, such as not considering tail dependency and lacking sub-additivity.
2. Expected Shortfall (ES): An improvement over VaR, ES is a coherent risk measure that calculates the average loss in scenarios where losses exceed VaR. It satisfies properties like monotonicity and sub-additivity.
3. Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES): Measures the contribution of a single institution to the overall systemic risk, calculated as the expected loss of an institution conditional on the system's loss exceeding VaR.
4. Capital Shortfall (CS): The amount by which an institution's capital falls short during a crisis. It is influenced by factors like leverage, size, and risk exposure.
5. Long Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES): An extension of MES over a longer horizon, estimating the expected loss of an institution during a market crash.
