Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique for reducing the dimensionality of financial data while preserving important relationships. This article explores the mathematical foundations and practical applications of PCA.

## Key Concepts

PCA works by:
- Finding directions of maximum variance in the data
- Creating orthogonal basis vectors (principal components)
- Projecting data onto lower-dimensional spaces

## Mathematical Framework

The optimization problem can be expressed as:

$$v^{*}=\underset{v}{\operatorname{argmax}} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\langle x_i,v\rangle^2$$

where:
- $v^{*}$ is the first principal component
- $x_i$ represents the i-th data point
- $N$ is the number of observations

This leads to eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix:

$$\Sigma = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)(x_i-\mu)^T$$
