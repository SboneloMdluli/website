The Limit Order Book (LOB) is a fundamental mechanism in modern financial markets that facilitates price discovery and trading. This piece examines how LOBs work and their importance in market structure.

## Key Components

A limit order book contains:
- All active buy and sell orders
- Order volumes and prices
- Submission timestamps
- The current bid-ask spread

## Order Matching Protocols

Two main approaches are used:

1. Price-Time Priority (PTP)
- Orders sorted by price then time
- Rewards quick order submission
- Most common in equity markets

2. Pro Rata
- Orders at same price filled proportionally
- Encourages larger order sizes
- Common in some derivatives markets

The choice of protocol influences trader behavior and market efficiency.
