I am a quantitative researcher focused on applying mathematical and computational methods to financial markets. My research interests include:

- Market microstructure and limit order book dynamics
- Fixed income risk analysis and modeling
- Machine learning applications in finance
- Statistical arbitrage strategies

My work combines rigorous mathematical analysis with practical implementation, using tools like:

- Python for quantitative analysis and modeling
- Machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch)
- Financial data analysis and visualization
- Statistical modeling and optimization

I maintain a research blog exploring topics in quantitative finance, from bond pricing models to market microstructure analysis. My goal is to bridge theoretical finance with practical implementation through clear, well-documented research and code.
