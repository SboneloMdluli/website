However, VaR has limitations, such as not considering tail dependency and lacking sub-additivity. Expected Shortfall (ES): An improvement over VaR, ES is a coherent risk measure that calculates the average loss in scenarios where losses exceed VaR. It satisfies properties like monotonicity and sub-additivity. Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES): Measures the contribution of a single institution to the overall systemic risk, calculated as the expected loss of an institution conditional on the system’s loss exceeding VaR. Capital Shortfall (CS): The amount by which an institution’s capital falls short during a crisis. It is influenced by factors like leverage, size, and risk exposure. Long Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES): An extension of MES over a longer horizon, estimating the expected loss of an institution during a market crash.

Coupons are regular payments, often expressed as a percentage of the face value.
